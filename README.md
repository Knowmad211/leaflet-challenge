This is my repository for the Module 15 Challenge Assignment of the Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp.
The prompt for this assignment is as follows:

"The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet."

# Contents
This repository contains one deliverable:
- [logic.js](Leaflet-Part-1/static/js/logic.js) which is the JavaScript file used to create the map visualizing the earthquake data pulled from the USGS.

# Source Data
- The data for this assignment was extracted from the the USGS Earthquake Hazard Program, looking at all of the data over the [Last 7 Days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson).

# References
- The code written for this assignment was written using the [Leaflet Documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html), examples from class, class notes, examples from StackOverflow, and ChatGPT, along with collaboration and help from my classmates, and Tutors.
